# Pipe

## Overview

This library exposes a simple API that allows you to apply a chain of filters and/or validators against arbitrary data.

## Installation

Through composer:

```
composer require flsouto/pipe
```

## Usage

The following example adds a 'trim' filter and a custom filter which replaces 4, 1 and 0 with a,i and o:

#mdx:1 -php

The above code will output:

#mdx:1 -o

So all your filter function has to do is to accept a value, modify and return it.

## Validation

The next example uses the same API but this time makes sure the input value doesn't have a number '4'.

#mdx:2 -php -h:autoload

The above snippet outputs:

#mdx:2 -o

So, if your filter *prints* something out, then it is considered to be a ***validator*** instead of a regular filter. The printed error message will be available in the `$result->error` property.

## Using Filters and Validation Together

In the following code snippet you have a filter happening before the validation, so the validation does not failed.

#mdx:3 -php -h:autoload,use

This is just to ilustrate that filters and validators can work together. Notice the order they are applied is the same order they are added to the pipe.

## Defining a Fallback

The fallback method allows you to define a default value to be returned in case any error occurs:

#mdx:4 -php -h:autoload,use

The output will be:

#mdx:4 -o

## Alternative syntax

You can use the *addArray* method to add an array of filters at once or you can instantiate the Pipe class through the *create* method which accepts an array of filters too:

#mdx:5 -php -h:autoload,use

## Final Thoughts

There are no final thoughts - this is just the beginning (:
